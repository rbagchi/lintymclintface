## Rubik's cube solver
Please write a java program which solves a rubik's cube. Use modern libraries outside of the problem domain (eg jackson, junit), but I want you to develop your own solver. Make sure it's adequately unit tested.

Refer to the instructions at ../INSTRUCTIONS.md for a build procedure, in particular, I want you to use the lintymclintface java linter to quickly verify that the generated java is intact before using bazel for the build
